# PyYomi

PyYomi is an Electron desktop manga reader with a local FastAPI backend.

This app is designed for:

- Open manga details, chapter list, and chapter downloads
- Read chapters with keyboard navigation
- Queue, pause, resume, cancel, and delete chapter downloads
- Set custom download folder with structure:
  - `/path/<manga-name>/<chapter>/<pages>`
- Use metadata image caching for faster repeat loads

## Download Path and File Layout

Set in `Settings`:

Download folders are saved as:
- `/your/path/<manga-slug>/Chapter_###__<chapter-title-slug>/<001.ext>`

## Caching

PyYomi supports backend image metadata caching for covers/thumbnails.
Configurable in `Settings`:
- Cache enabled
- Max bytes
- TTL hours

## Data and Logs

Desktop runtime keeps backend data/logs under app user data directories.
Typical locations include backend DB and logs used by Electron-managed backend runtime.

If troubleshooting, check:
- Electron main log location printed by app startup errors
- Backend log file under backend data dir

## Troubleshooting

### Chapter download fails immediately

- Confirm source is selected and available on `Sources` page
- Retry download from manga details
- Check Downloads error text

### Reader shows wrong page briefly

- Ensure latest version (`v1.0.1+`)
- Reader now blocks old frame and shows loading until new page is ready

### Installer builds but release assets are missing online

- Git tag alone is not enough; a GitHub Release object must exist
- Attach generated `.exe` and `.blockmap` to release if workflow did not publish

## Project Structure

- `frontend/`: React + Vite UI
- `backend/`: FastAPI, SQLModel, source extensions, download manager
- `electron/`: Desktop shell and packaging
- `docs/`: architecture and extension docs

## Notes for Maintainers

- Tag workflow: `.github/workflows/auto-version-tag.yml`
- Release workflow: `.github/workflows/release-electron.yml`
- Electron artifact name uses app version in `electron/package.json` unless overridden in builder config
